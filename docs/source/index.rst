Robin Stocks: Python Trading on Wall St.
=========================================

-----

.. image:: _static/pics/robin.jpg

This library aims to create simple to use functions to interact with the
Robinhood API. This is a pure python interface and it requires Python 3. The purpose
of this library is to allow people to make their own robo-investors or to view
stock information in real time.

.. note::

  These functions make real time calls to your Robinhood account. Unlike in the app, there are
  no warnings when you are about to buy, sell, or cancel an order. It is up to **YOU** to use
  these commands responsibly.
