# Let's say you bought five 4/20/20 calls of spy at 300 for 1.00 per contract.
# You would like to sell the calls for 2.00 per contract so you double your money (minus premium).
# Also, you want the order to last until you cancel it. You would sell to close like this.

# Let's say you sold one 4/20/20 put of spy at 200 for 5.00 per contract.
# You would like to buy the puts for 2.50 per contract so you double your money (plus premium).
# Also, you only want the order to last the day. You would buy to close like this.

# if you don't already own these contracts then robinhood should return an error and not let the order go through.
